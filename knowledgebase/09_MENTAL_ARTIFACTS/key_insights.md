# Key Insights

## Core Insights

- Flow states are predictable from multi-modal correlational patterns
- Cognitive output is optimizable given controlled baseline variables
- An LLM trained on personal data creates compounding returns (exponential)
- State transitions have measurable costs that can be minimized

## Artifact-Related Insights

- Different LLM models have different artifact success rates - reveals model-specific capabilities
- Artifacts can be systematically classified by rarity, creating a formal taxonomy of reasoning modes
- Cognitive artifacts bridge prompt engineering and cognitive science - formalized mental tools
- Artifact testing reveals emergent behaviors that weren't explicitly programmed in training
