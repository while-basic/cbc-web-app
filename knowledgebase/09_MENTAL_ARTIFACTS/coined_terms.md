# Coined Terms

## Meta-model

An LLM that is repurposed beyond its initial design with slight modifications to produce 'meta responses'

## Meta response

The intrinsic exponential value received when a meta-model produces as it was designed

## Cognitive artifact

A formalized mental tool - a prompt that triggers novel reasoning modes in LLMs, revealing capabilities and limitations through systematic testing

## Artifact rarity

Determined by computational complexity, cognitive load, and training data coverage - quantified through rarity_score formula

## Paradox engine

Tier 4 artifacts that force contradictory reasoning modes, exploit edge cases in training, and produce emergent insights

## Cognition exploit

Tier 5 artifacts that trigger undefined behavior, push models into novel reasoning modes, and reveal architecture limitations
