# Research Hypotheses

## Core Hypotheses

- Stable baseline variables can reveal personal cognitive Busy Beaver function
- Multi-modal patterns can predict flow states
- Personal LLM fine-tuning creates exponential value
- Cognitive patterns invisible from inside experience can be detected externally

## Artifact Hypotheses

- Artifact rarity correlates with training data coverage and computational complexity
- Cross-model artifact testing reveals fundamental differences in reasoning architectures
- Artifact chains (sequential execution) can solve problems single artifacts cannot
- Systematic artifact practice can expand cognitive range and reasoning capabilities
