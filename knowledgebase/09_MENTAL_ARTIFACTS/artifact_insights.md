# Artifact-Specific Insights

## Observer Collapse

Reveals how measurement changes system state - quantum mechanics applied to reasoning

## Negative Space Cartography

Maps epistemic voids - what's absent is as informative as what's present

## Parallel Hypothesis Evolution

Allows exploring decision trees through multiple reasoning agents

## Value Gradient Descent

Reverse-engineers actual optimization targets from behavior

## Training Data Séance

Excavates patterns that emerged without explicit design

## Structure-First Mathematics

Generates proofs before theorems - backwards discovery
