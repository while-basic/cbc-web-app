# Neural Child

## Description

Developmental AI architecture with five interacting neural networks that simulate child cognitive development through stages (Infant → Toddler → Child → Adolescent → Mature).

## Status

Launching January 2026 with Celaya Solutions

## Technologies

- PyTorch neural networks
- Multi-network architecture
- Developmental learning
- MessageBus communication
- Mother LLM guidance system

## Architecture

### Networks

- Consciousness Network - self-awareness and metacognition
- Perception Network - sensory input processing
- Emotions Network - emotional state generation
- Thoughts Network - cognitive processing and belief formation
- Language Network - linguistic understanding influenced by emotional state

### Subsystems

- Belief Network - forms and maintains beliefs through experience
- Memory System - working memory (LSTM) and long-term memory (GRU)
- Moral Network - ethical reasoning
- Metacognition System - self-awareness

## Key Innovation

Five specialized, interacting neural networks that mirror core cognitive systems, rather than one monolithic network.
