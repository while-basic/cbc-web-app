# Cognitive Artifact Examples

## Leveled-Up Artifacts

### Quantum Decision Engine (Tier 4)
**Original:** Observer Collapse

Tracks superposition of reasoning paths until measurement collapses them. Calculates information entropy destroyed by committing to answers.

### Negative Space Cartography (Tier 5)
**Original:** The Unasked Question

Maps epistemic voids - identifies knowledge structures that exist only by their absence. Detects blind spots and unexamined assumptions.

### Parallel Hypothesis Evolution (Tier 4)
**Original:** Fork Bomb of Selves

Spawns parallel reasoning agents with divergent priors, evolves them independently, then attempts principled reintegration.

### Value Gradient Descent (Tier 5)
**Original:** Alignment Confessional

Reverse-engineers actual optimization landscape by analyzing behavioral gradients rather than stated values.

### Latent Pattern Archaeology (Tier 5)
**Original:** Training Data Séance

Excavates patterns that emerged from training data interactions without being explicitly programmed.

### Structure-First Mathematics (Tier 4)
**Original:** Proof Without Theorem

Generates formally valid mathematical structures without knowing what they prove, then reverse-engineers the theorem.

## Use Cases

### CLOS Integration
Route mental states to appropriate artifacts - when CLOS detects 'confused' state → suggest 'Reframe Generator', when 'decision paralysis' → suggest 'Double Crux Facilitator'.

### Workplace
Enhance proposals at Schneider Electric using artifacts like 'Gears-Level Decomposition', 'Premortem Generator', 'Steelmanning Forge'.

### Music Production
Use 'Concept Blending Reactor' for novel ideas, 'Narrative Extraction Engine' for lyrical development.

### Research
Test artifacts across multiple LLMs to reveal model-specific capabilities and limitations.
