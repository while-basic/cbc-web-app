# Cognitive Artifacts / ACP (Autonomous Collaborative Protocol)

## Description

Sophisticated prompts designed to enhance human reasoning, with formal taxonomy and minting standards. ACP is a decentralized intelligent ecosystem for autonomous value creation, immutable proof, and trustless coordination. Cognitive artifacts are formalized mental tools - prompts that trigger novel reasoning modes in LLMs, revealing capabilities and limitations through systematic testing.

## Status

Framework complete with formal taxonomy and minting standards. Development ongoing - various artifact types not fully planned or labeled yet.

## Technologies

- Prompt engineering
- Behavioral modification frameworks
- IPFS integration
- Blockchain notarization
- Decentralized agent coordination
- Artifact registry architecture
- Python library for artifact execution
- Cross-model testing framework

## Taxonomy

**Standard:** CLAS-1 (Cognitive Language Artifact Standard)

### Tier 1 - Common: Standard Prompts
- Computational complexity: O(n)
- Cognitive load: 1-2/10
- Training coverage: >80%
- Examples: "Summarize this", "Translate to Spanish", "List 5 ideas"

### Tier 2 - Uncommon: Structured Prompts
- Computational complexity: O(n log n)
- Cognitive load: 3-4/10
- Training coverage: 40-80%
- Examples: Chain-of-thought, Few-shot learning, Structured output

### Tier 3 - Rare: Cognitive Artifacts
- Computational complexity: O(n²)
- Cognitive load: 5-7/10
- Training coverage: 10-40%
- Rarity score: 0.60-0.85
- Examples: Compression Artifact Detector, Legibility Threshold Detector, Steelmanning Forge

### Tier 4 - Epic: Paradox Engines
- Computational complexity: O(n² log n)
- Cognitive load: 7-8/10
- Training coverage: 5-10%
- Rarity score: 0.85-0.95

- Cognitive load: 10/10
- Training coverage: <1%
- Rarity score: 0.99+
- Achievement status: Theoretical
- Examples: Self-modifying prompt that optimizes itself, Prompt that forces model to question its existence, Recursive improvement loop

## Minting Standard

**CLAS-1 (Cognitive Language Artifact Standard) v1.0.0**

Includes: artifact_id (UUID v4), artifact_name, artifact_hash (SHA-256), creator, created_at, version, classification, provenance, execution_metadata, usage_analytics, licensing, artifact_content, research_metadata, community features.

## Key Concepts

- **Meta-model:** LLM repurposed beyond initial design to produce meta responses
- **Meta response:** Intrinsic exponential value received when meta-model produces as designed
- **Cognitive artifacts:** Formalized mental tools
- **Rarity:** Determined by computational complexity, cognitive load, and training data coverage

## Vision

First verifiable intelligence network enabling autonomous value creation with immutable proof. Position as the person who systematized prompt engineering - creating a new category of cognitive tools with formal taxonomy, minting standard, measurement framework, and research methodology.
