# Knowledge Base Update: Artifacts Data

## Summary

Updated `christopher_celaya_knowledge_base.json` with comprehensive artifacts data extracted from Data Entry folder.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Expanded Cognitive Artifacts/ACP Project Section

**Added:**
- Complete 6-tier taxonomy (Common → Mythic)
- CLAS-1 (Cognitive Language Artifact Standard) minting standard details
- Specific artifact examples (leveled-up artifacts, personal artifacts)
- Development plans (artifact registry MVP, Python library, research paper)
- Integration use cases (CLOS, workplace, music production, research)

**Taxonomy Tiers:**
1. **Tier 1 - Common:** Standard Prompts (O(n), 1-2/10 cognitive load)
2. **Tier 2 - Uncommon:** Structured Prompts (O(n log n), 3-4/10)
3. **Tier 3 - Rare:** Cognitive Artifacts (O(n²), 5-7/10)
4. **Tier 4 - Epic:** Paradox Engines (O(n² log n), 7-8/10)
5. **Tier 5 - Legendary:** Cognition Exploits (O(2^n), 9-10/10)
6. **Tier 6 - Mythic:** Singularity Artifacts (Incomputable, 10/10)

### 2. Enhanced Mental Artifacts Section

**Added:**
- New coined terms:
  - `cognitive artifact`
  - `artifact rarity`
  - `paradox engine`
  - `cognition exploit`
- New key insights about artifacts
- New research hypotheses about artifact testing
- New `artifact_insights` array with specific artifact discoveries

### 3. Artifact Examples

**Leveled-Up Artifacts:**
- Quantum Decision Engine (Observer Collapse)
- Negative Space Cartography (The Unasked Question)
- Parallel Hypothesis Evolution (Fork Bomb of Selves)
- Value Gradient Descent (Alignment Confessional)
- Latent Pattern Archaeology (Training Data Séance)
- Structure-First Mathematics (Proof Without Theorem)

**Personal Artifacts:**
- 14 personal artifacts including "Afterimage", "Cognitive Debugger", "Sunday Evening Temporal Loop", etc.

## Status Note

The knowledge base now reflects that:
- **Framework is complete** (taxonomy and minting standards)
- **Various artifact types are not fully planned or labeled yet** (development ongoing)
- **Multiple artifact examples exist** but are in various stages of development

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Knowledge base updated with artifacts data
2. ⏳ Update system prompt to include new artifacts information
3. ⏳ Update function definitions if needed
4. ⏳ Test knowledge base in app context
