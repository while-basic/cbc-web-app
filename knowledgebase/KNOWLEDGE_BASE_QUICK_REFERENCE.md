## 🚀 For Your App

### Bundle These 3 Files:

```
Resources/Data/
├── knowledge_base.json          ✅ (Main knowledge base)
├── claude_functions.json        ✅ (Function definitions)
└── system_prompt.txt            ✅ (Claude system prompt)
```

### That's It!

The knowledge base JSON contains everything extracted from the relevant source folders. No need to include the source folders themselves for MVP.
