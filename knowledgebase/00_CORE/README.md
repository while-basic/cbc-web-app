# Knowledge Base - Drag & Drop System

## Quick Start: Adding New Information

1. **Write your mental note** as a markdown file
2. **Drag and drop** into the appropriate category directory
3. **AI automatically has access** to the latest information

## How to Add New Information

### Example Workflow

1. **You have a mental note:** "New insight about flow states"
2. **Create a markdown file:** `flow_state_insight_2025-01-15.md`
3. **Write your note:**
   ```markdown
   # Flow State Insight - January 2025
   
   Discovered that flow states correlate with...
   ```
4. **Drag and drop** into `06_COGNITIVE_PATTERNS/` or `09_MENTAL_ARTIFACTS/`
5. **Done!** The AI system will automatically read this file

### File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `topic_description_date.md`
- Dates help track when information was added
- Examples:
  - `clos_update_2025-01-15.md`
  - `new_artifact_idea_2025-01-15.md`
  - `research_finding_2025-01-15.md`

## Best Practices

1. **One topic per file** - Keep files focused
2. **Use markdown** - Headers, lists, code blocks work well
3. **Date your entries** - Helps track information freshness
4. **Be specific** - Clear, actionable information
5. **Update existing files** - If adding to existing topic, edit the relevant file

## System Integration

The AI system automatically:
- Reads all `.md` files in category directories
- Incorporates new information into responses
- Maintains context across all files
- Updates knowledge base dynamically

## Template File

See `TEMPLATE.md` in each category directory for a starting point.
