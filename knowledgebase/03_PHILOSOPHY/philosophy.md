# Philosophy & Approach

## Core Principle

"I just wanted to connect different things, connect them, and see what happens."

## Approach

Systematic self-experimentation and documentation

## Methodology

Cross-domain synthesis connecting electrical systems to cognitive research

## Research Style

Builds first, reads later - empirical-first research like Faraday and the Wright Brothers

## Recognition Seeking

Wants to be recognized as different rather than merely intelligent - values recognition of seeing things others don't see

## Intellectual Goal

Contributing undiscovered knowledge to humanity through systematic self-experimentation - seeks intellectual immortality through academic citation

## Work Philosophy

Building complete systems, not just executing existing frameworks. Defaults to depth over breadth.
